# XRPL-Plugin

Xrpl-Plugin bridges the gap with e-commerce software platforms and crypto currencies. Shopping carts currently accept payments through gateway systems that are slow and costly. Xrpl-Plugin decreases the payout time from days to less than .04 seconds and significantly reduces transaction fees from 2-5% to roughly .004 cents. The xrpl-plugin intergrates into the shopping cart software as a hybrid plugin transforming the checkout page parameters without the need to re-design the existing website. Below are a few shopping carts/ platforms that we aim to support.

- Open Cart
- Wordpress
- Magento
- Presta
- Shopify
- Facebook Store
- Instagram
- Tick Tok
